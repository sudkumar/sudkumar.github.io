`Keys` are very important part of React/similar UI frameworks. Whenever we have a list of DOM nodes, React needs the `key`
prop to identify every item in the list. You can think of these keys as the IDs of the rendered elements, similar to how
we have/need our ID cards when we are standing in a queue.

You should checkout the React docs on [Why does React need keys?](https://react.dev/learn/rendering-lists#why-does-react-need-keys) for more details.

## Problem with Indexes as Keys in Forms

If you are have Array Input Fields ([Controlled](https://react.dev/reference/react-dom/components/input#controlling-an-input-with-a-state-variable)) 
in the Forms in your React-like environment, you might be using the index or something similar for the `key` prop to 
pass the individual controlled field item.

This example allows you to get (random) rates for different hotels by their name. You can click on `Add More` to add
more hotels and click on `Remove` to remove a hotel and type in the hotel's name to get the rates. The rate field is
reactive to the hotel's name field.

> We are using [React Final Form](https://final-form.org/react) but you can choose any available options. This is not
> and issue the form libraries.

Here we are using the `index` of the Array as the key for the individual item. <mark>The problem comes when we try to
remove an item from the list. The removal of an item is causing rates to be refetched for all the following items.</mark>

<Problem client:load />


This is simple form but in reality you can imagine having a very nested array where values of some other 
(nested) fields are reactive to the values of some other fields.

<summary>Real-World Field Array</summary>

In one of [my project](https://sembark.com), I have a form with array fields having 4 depth as shown below. This
allows a user to retrieve the rates of Transportation based on dates and selected cabs.

```ts
type TTransportAndActivities = Array<{ // <- Field Array
  dates: Array<Date>,
  services: Array<{ // <- Field Array
    type: "transport" | "activity" // there are some other types as well
    service: {
        id: number,
        service_id: number,
        cabs: Array<{ // <- Field Array
          cab_type: string,
          no_of_cabs: number,
          date_wise_rates: Array<{ // <- Field Array
              date: string,
              rate: number, // rate fetched via an API
              custom_rate: number // customized rate entered by you (user)
          }>
        }>
    }
  }>
}>
```

In the form, if you change any data (e.g. `dates`, `service_id`, `cab_type`), it will result in following:

1. *refetch* of the rates 
2. **will reset the `custom_rate` field**.

These two points are important. Essentially, these two points means that values of some other fields are
reactive to the values of some other fields.

### What is happening

As stated earlier, the keys are the identities of the items in a list. Because we are using the `index` as the key
of the list items, removal of an i<sup>th</sup> item is replacing this item with i+1<sup>th</sup> because in the next
redering process, i+1<sup>th</sup> item becomes the i<sup>th</sup> item. 

Let's understand it with an example. Suppose, you and I are standing in a queue to buy tickets and we are given a token number (key)
which is our ordering number in the queue. I am standing right behind you. Support you get a token number as 5, and so I will get 
the 6 number. 

```sh
# TICKET QUEUE
ID 1. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6. 7. 8. 9.
   |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
               |  |
              You |
                 Me
```

Suddenly you get a call and have to leave for some urgent work, and so your leave. Now what happens with token numbers ?
As you gussed, I get the number 5 and all other behind me follow with the new token number (old - 1) but the people ahead of me stays 
the same. 

```sh
# TICKET QUEUE
ID 1. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6. 7. 8.
   |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | 
               |
               |
              Me
              
```

Now, there is someone who is inspecting the queue. This person will notice as if all the people from token 5 onwards have been
changed, instead of the reality, which is that the number 5 is gone and other are the same. 

This inspector is React in the case of our list items and it **will see as if the items has been updated, instead of an item being remove**. 
Ofcourse as the item is removed, the length is not smaller and so the very last index from earlier has been updated, which doen't 
matter as there is no item there any longer.

In our example, when we remove an item (say 2<sup>nd</sup> and hotel's name being Hotel 2), the following (3<sup>rd</sup> and hotel's name being Hotel 3)
item will get its key. React will see as if someone has updated it's (2<sup>nd</sup>'s) content (hotel's name) with the new content (from name Hotel 2 to Hotel 3) and
so the rates will be refetched.

To tests that the rates are getting refetched because of content change, you can do the following:
1. Set the name of hotel in 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> item to "Hotel A".
2. Set the name of the 3<sup>rd</sup> item to something else e.g. "Hotel XYZ".
3. Now remove the first item. 

You will see that 

1. The rate for the new first item will <b>NOT</b> be fetched. It will keep the rates from older deleted item (1<sup>st</sup>), instead of the rate of the replacing item.
2. The rate for new second item will be fetched.

## Solution

Instead of relying on the index of the list item, we can associate an identity to every list item by adding a new field (e.g. __id).

<Solution client:load  />

Some Form libraries like [React Hook Form](https://react-hook-form.com/) provides ways to handle the keys for array fields with [some
constraints on how to use field array](https://react-hook-form.com/docs/usefieldarray#rules).

We all have use `ssh username@ip` in our development cycle or some of us start their development by doing it. What our general flow is ?

```sh
$ user@local:> ssh username@ip
Please enter your password >
.
.
$ user@ip:>
```

We have to remember a few things to do this action: **username**, **ip**, and **password**. That's is a lot. What we if can simply say `ssh todev` :). Let's see how we can ease this process.

## Using ssh config

We can ssh*config file to manage our ssh logins. Our *~/.ssh/config\* file contains our ssh
related configurations. We can use this file to hold our server ips, our usernames, preferred
authentication methods (publickey or password) and some other stuffs. Let's see how we can imporove it.
Let's assume that we have following credentials available.

- **Server IP:** _172.01.01.12_ (our server's ip or hostname)
- **Username:** _my_user_name_ (our user name for server)
- **Password:** _secretpassword_ (our password for server)

Let's first setup our basic ssh configuration

1.  Create a _`~/.ssh/config`_ file if not already present
2.  Append following lines to our _config_ file

```sh
Host my_server_login_identifier 172.01.01.12
HostName 172.01.01.12
User my_user_name # set PreferredAuthentications to <b>publickey</b> if you have added public/private key authentication
PreferredAuthentications password # uncomment the line bellow if you have setup the public/private keys authentication # IdentityFile ~/.ssh/my_server_rsa
AddKeysToAgent yes
```

3.Now we can do `ssh my_server_login_identifier` to login to our server. This will
ask us for our password. If you get error for invalid _AddKeysToAgent_ key, just remove it.

## Setting up public/private key authentication

Now let's add public/private key authentication method for our server. Some servers may not allow
this method of authentication based of configuration but mostly does. So let's start.

### Generating ssh public/private key pair

1. Change your current working directory to _~/.ssh_
2. Create a ssh public/private key pair by running `ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "myemail@domain.com" -f my_server_rsa` into our terminal. We should provide a
   pass-phrase for better security. And remember it for some time.
3. Here _my_server_rsa_ is the file name (default is id_rsa). We should always provide and
   email id for better identification of owner as the provided email id is appended to our
   generated public key.
4. Now let ssh-agent remember out _pass-phrase_. Start agent by running `eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"` followed by `ssh-add -K ~/.ssh/my_server_rsa`. This
   will ask for pass-phrase.
5. Now lets copy the content of _~/.ssh/my_server_rsa.pub_ into clipboard
6. `cat ~/.ssh/my_server_rsa` and copy the output from terminal.

### Server side authorization configuration

Now let see how we can let server know we are an authorized user with a public key.

1. Login into our server with `ssh my_server_login_identifier` along with our
   password.
2. Create _~/.ssh_ directory if not already present and _cd ~/.ssh_
3. Create _authorized_keys_ file if not already present and append the content of
   clipboard (our public key) to it.
4. Now let's logout

### Update local ssh configuration for ssh keys

Now that we updated our server for authentication, we need to updated our local ssh configuration to use the public/private key authentication and which key to use for authentication.

1.  Open our _~/.ssh/config_ file.
2.  Lets add _IdentityFile_ and _PreferredAuthentications_ into our configuration for
    out server
3.  Our final configuration should look like this.

```sh
Host my_server_login_identifier 172.01.01.12
HostName 172.01.01.12
User my_user_name
PreferredAuthentications publickey
IdentityFile ~/.ssh/my_server_rsa
AddKeysToAgent yes
```

4.  Now login into server by running `ssh my_server_login_identifier`. We should be
    able to directly login into the server. If you get an error for invalid credentials, remove
    the 172.01.01.12 line from _~/.ssh/known_hosts_ and you should be good to go.

That's it. We have completed our _ssh_ setup. Now we can simply login with our ssh
identifier.

## What we achieved

1. `ssh my_server_login_identifier` to login into server
1. If server ip changes, update your **~/.ssh/config** with new ip and just put your existing publickey to new server as mention above.
1. If your username changes, just update the **~/.ssh/config** with new username
1. Share your configuration with your team or put it in **CONTRIBUTION or wiki** of your project so that any new developer can start easily.
